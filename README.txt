----------------------------

We used jQuery to make it easier to use javascript on our website. jQuery does this by taking many common tasks that require
many lines of code to accomplish and wraps them into methods that can be called with one line of code. This simplified our work for us a lot.

Chartist.js is a charting library that we chose to represent the charts that we want to display in our website. We chose chartist because it is fully 
responsive and it also has great flexibility while making sure to sepereate styling with CSS from control with JS.

We chose to use bootstrap because of our limited time and limited skill. Bootstrap is a framework that helps people design websites faster and easier. Using 
bootstrap also simplified our work, it is lightweight and customizable and also supports majority of all browsers.

Popper.js is a positioning engine, it calculates the position of an element so it makes it possible to position it next to another element. We used this mostly for our charts.

PHP was used for our backend,

For this project, we did not make use of any data structure. We made use of a database

We are also using a simple PHP REST API to read, update and manipulate our database.  REST APIs are the foundation of new network technologies. There are many 
frameworks that can help people build REST APIs quickly. These APIs allow us to create, edit, and securely store user accounts and user account data, and connect 
them with one or more applications.
